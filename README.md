# Infra-as-Code-RestAPI

**A simple, production-minded DevOps project that deploys a Python REST API backed by MySQL. Infrastructure is created with Terraform on AWS. The application runs on an EC2 instance and connects to an RDS MySQL database. Jenkins provides CI/CD to build, test, and deploy the app. This README gives step-by-step instructions to reproduce the project locally and in AWS**

# 1 â€” Project overview

This project demonstrates a typical web application deployment flow:

-Infrastructure as code with Terraform to create VPC, subnets, security groups, EC2 instance, and RDS MySQL instance.

-Python REST API that performs CRUD against MySQL.

-Jenkins pipeline that pulls code, runs tests, builds a package, and deploys to EC2.

-Minimal production practices: environment variables, security groups, least privilege IAM role for EC2 or Terraform user, and proper cleanup scripts.

 # 2 â€” ARCHITECTURE 

<img width="763" height="426" alt="Screenshot 2025-10-17 185356" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8f593174-0a59-4d98-9524-920cd3f2546c" />

Web client -> REST API (running on EC2) -> MySQL on RDS
Terraform provisions EC2 and RDS. Jenkins orchestrates CI/CD.

# 3 â€” Components used

-AWS: VPC, Subnet, Internet Gateway, Route Tables, Security Groups, EC2 (Linux), RDS MySQL

-Terraform: for infrastructure

-Python: Flask or FastAPI for REST API

-MySQL client library (e.g. mysql-connector-python or pymysql)

-Jenkins: for CI/CD

-Git: source control

-(Optional) Nginx or Gunicorn for serving the Python app in production

-(Optional) Systemd for process management on EC2 or Docker if you prefer containers

# 4 â€” Prerequisites

-An AWS account with programmatic access. Ability to create EC2, RDS, IAM, VPC resources.

-Terraform installed (v1.x recommended).

-AWS CLI installed and configured.

-Jenkins server or Jenkins in Docker.

-Git, Python 3.8+ on local machine and EC2 AMI.

-Basic AWS IAM permissions for Terraform and Jenkins: create/update/delete EC2, RDS, VPC, security groups, and optionally IAM roles.

-A domain name is optional if you want DNS.
